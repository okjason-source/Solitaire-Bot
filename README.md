# Solitaire Card Game - Billionaire Mindset Edition

A modern, luxurious implementation of the classic Klondike Solitaire card game with a "Billionaire Mindset" theme featuring money green tones, gold accents, and premium styling. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🎮 How to Play

### Objective
Build up the four foundation piles (one for each suit) from Ace to King in ascending order.

### Game Rules

1. **Tableau Piles**: The main playing area consists of 7 piles where you can build descending sequences of alternating colors (red/black). You can move entire sequences of cards together.

2. **Foundation Piles**: The four piles at the top where you build ascending sequences from Ace to King, all of the same suit.

3. **Stock Pile**: Click the card back to draw **3 cards at a time** to the waste pile. When the stock is empty, click again to reset from the waste pile.

4. **Waste Pile**: The top card can be moved to the tableau or foundation piles.

### How to Move Cards

- **Drag and Drop**: Click and drag cards to move them between piles. Drag any card in a sequence to move the entire sequence from that card down.
- **Click to Move**: Click on cards in the waste pile to automatically move them to valid destinations
